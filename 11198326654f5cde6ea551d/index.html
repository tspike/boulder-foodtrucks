<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">What is this website?</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">It's a site to help the cause of making Boulder friendly to food trucks! Boulder's regulations, while recently relaxed, are still stifling this growing and fun industry. I created this site because I love food trucks and don't want to see owners discouraged by overwhelming regulations. When I saw that the existing food truck owners had started a petition to keep things moving in a positive direction, I decided to help!</div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">Things are moving in the right direction</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><ul style=""><li style="">Boulder City Council&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/business/ci_19887493" title="" style="">recently started allowing food trucks in Boulder</a>. Awesome!<br /></li><li style="">Downtown restaurant owners worked with the city council to help make this happen. Thank you!</li><li style="">Boulder's food trucks are thriving in software company parking lots, helping to give office workers a lot more in the way of delicious, affordable options.</li></ul></div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">OK, what needs work?</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; "><ul><li><font size="2"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The downtown location restrictions are too strict. It's very difficult for a truck owner to legally set up anywhere in Downtown Boulder.</span></font></li><li><font size="2"><span style="line-height: 19px;">The rule that truck owners must close by 9PM needs to be revised. There are very few late night food options in Boulder and food trucks are a perfect fit!</span></font></li><li>Food trucks are currently not allowed to park within 200 feet of each other, along with other restrictions. This prevents food truck "pods" which have a number of benefits.</li></ul></div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">I'm convinced. What can I do?</h2>

<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; "><ul><li>Sign the petition! It's easy and makes a big difference. Be sure to add weight to your signature by using your full, real name and relevant comments.<br /></li></ul></div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">I still need more convincing.</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">I've added a few sections below with more detailed explanations of each of the key issues.</div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">Downtown location restrictions</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">According to <a href="http://www.colocode.com/boulder2/chapter9-6.htm#section9_6_5" title="">BRC 9-6-5(d)</a>, food trucks must be located at least 150 feet away from both restaurants and residential areas. On top of this, in downtown, they are only permitted on private property and only with the written consent of the employer. Shannon Aten "noted the map provided by the city indicating two-dozen 'possible mobile food vending' sites within downtown Boulder. <strong>The vast majority of the highlighted areas were buildings.</strong>" (emphasis mine, source: Boulder Daily Camera)<br /><br />This is a de facto prohibition against downtown food trucks. Possible solutions include:&nbsp;<br /><br /><ol><li><strong>Setting aside a public area downtown for food trucks.</strong> The most common objection to food trucks being allowed downtown is that restaurant owners pay a lot of money for the right to be downtown. At least give food truck owners the same option!&nbsp;<br /></li><li><strong>Allowing food trucks to set up in any&nbsp;private lot. </strong>The distance restrictions rule out nearly all viable vacant lots in downtown. Even willing property owners are unable to rent out their land.</li><li><strong>&lt;insert your solution here&gt; </strong>-- democracy works best when people speak up and work together! I'm just a regular guy, not a lawyer, not a food truck owner, and not a restaurant owner. You guys really need to chime in!&nbsp;</li></ol></div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">Late night restriction</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.colocode.com/boulder2/chapter9-6.htm#section9_6_5" title="" style="">BRC 9-6-5(d)</a>,&nbsp;food trucks must cease operations at 9PM. This provision doesn't make sense given the relative lack of late-night food options in Boulder. Benefits of relaxing this rule include:<br /><br /><ul><li><font size="2"><span style="line-height: 19px;">More efficient serving of food to the frequently intoxicated patrons flooding the streets late at night. It's widely known that <a href="http://www.alcohol.vt.edu/students/alcoholeffects/intoxfactors.htm" title="">food decreases the rate of alcohol absorption into the bloodstream</a>, and existing options are not sufficient to serve the volume of customers.</span></font></li><li><font size="2"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Gives food trucks an opportunity to widen their exposure and customer base while most brick and mortar restaurants are closed.</span></font></li><li><font size="2"><span style="line-height: 19px;">Food trucks are a more natural demographic fit to the bar crowd than traditional restaurants.</span></font></li></ul></div>

<h2  style=" text-align: left; ">Relative proximity restriction</h2>
<div  class="paragraph editable-text" style=" text-align: left; display: block; ">According to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.colocode.com/boulder2/chapter9-6.htm#section9_6_5" title="" style="">BRC 9-6-5(d)</a>, &nbsp;food trucks are not allowed to set up within 200 feet of one another, along with some other restrictions regarding proximity to one another. This restriction seems punitive and unnecessary. There's camaraderie among food truck owners, and the presence of food truck "pods" provides a diversity of good, affordable food options in close proximity to one another. These "pods" have numerous benefits:<br /><br /><br /><ol><li>Tourism. The food truck/cart scene in Portland, Oregon is a big tourism draw and hasn't adversely affected existing restaurants.</li><li>Convenience and ecological benefits. Groups of friends with different food tastes can converge on a single food truck "pod" for a variety of options without polluting the environment by splitting up and driving all over town.&nbsp;</li><li>Fun! All of this political stuff is so heavy sounding it's easy to forget how much fun this kind of delicious camaraderie can be.</li></ol></div>
